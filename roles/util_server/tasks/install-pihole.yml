# util_server-role/tasks/install-pihole.yml
# This will install pihole. The earlier tasks will also be taken care of
# by the pi-hole installation script. Because we are going for a non-interactive
# install, this presumes a config-directory, because the non-interactive pi-hole
# script expects setupVars.conf. This is why we need to perform
# some tasks doubly and through this script.
